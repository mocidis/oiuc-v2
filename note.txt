Conventions:
- Each cpp file = 1 CPP class except for: main.cpp, ctocpp.cpp, backend.cpp

Application Name: oiuc

List of CPP files:

- backend.cpp --> DB access wrapper utilities
- ctocpp.cpp --> callback functions for the project 
- main.cpp --> application entry point
- Log.cpp --> Log class for log pannel
- Config.cpp --> Config class for configuration of the OIUC app
- OIUC.cpp --> OIUC class that represents logics and behaviors of THIS oiu (singleton)
- OIU.cpp --> OIU class that wraps logic of another OIUC
- OIUList.cpp --> equivalent to the previous "oiuc_manager.cpp"
- Radio.cpp --> Radio class that wraps logic of a radio channel (e.g: Node)
- RadioList.cpp --> equivalent to the previous "radio_manager.cpp"
- Try to combine RadioList.cpp & OIUList.cpp 

(Pending) Find out a solution for versioning system:
- Integrated in to build system (Makefile, QT)
- Version queryable from a runing app
